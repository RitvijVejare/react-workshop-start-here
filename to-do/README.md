# ðŸ“œ To Do

## ðŸ¤” What's this about?

During the course of this workshop, you will be required to complete assignments on the project that we build together. These include coding or implementing features, so make sure you've grabbed a cup of coffee! â˜•

Alongwith your assignments, if you wish to learn more React, we suggest you try to build a project on your own by the end of the internship program. 

To help you choose a project, we curated some ideas but you are free to select a project of your choice!

- [Project Ideas here](https://github.com/salikadave/react-workshop-start-here/blob/main/to-do/project-ideas.md)

## ðŸŽ¯ Assignment Submission Guidelines:

- Open a PR to the template file you created earlier.
- Add the name of the assignment and the link to the GitHub repository to where we can find the code to review your work.
- No cheating! ðŸ¤¥ The commit history will be reviewed before you grade your submission.
- Check out the `attendes/template.md` to understand how to include links to your work. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Submission Guidelines:

- Must have a `README.md` file in the root directory providing instructions on:
    - A brief introduction about your project
    - How to run the project --> Try to rephrase the Create-React-App template
    - Challenges/Errors you ran into + how did you fix them
    - Technologies/Tools you used
- Preferably deployed to any of the cloud services. (Netlify / Heroku / AWS / Any other service you are comfortable with)

Go all out, you got this! ðŸ”¥
