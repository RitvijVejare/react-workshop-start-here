# Javascript Basics

This language is massive, so it's difficult to cover every aspect of it. But since we're learning React, we need to learn next-gen javascript, which is the ES6 version. We've put together some examples for you based on what we learnt.

At a later point we'll try to add more essential ES6 Feature Examples like _higher-order functions, promises, callbacks,_ etc.

### JS ES6:

1. let & const

- [Example](./variables.js)
